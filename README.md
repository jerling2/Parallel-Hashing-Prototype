# Parallel-Hashing-Prototype

Prototype aims to achieve:

1. Generate hashes to some constraint (e.g. last 5 characters are 1s).
2. Generate hashes to some constraint in parallel.

TODO:

1. Generate hash
2. Iteratively generate hashes to some constraint
3. Use Dask to add parallelization
4. Introduce diagnostic tools
